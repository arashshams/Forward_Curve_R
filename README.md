# Forward_Curve_R

This repo hosts a [script](https://github.com/arashshams/forward_curve_R/blob/master/Optimization.Rmd) in which optimization using R has been used to build a typical [Forward Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_curve#:~:text=The%20forward%20curve%20is%20a,payment%20can%20be%20concluded%20today.&text=The%20forward%20curve%20represents%20a%20term%20structure%20of%20prices.).

These curves have extensive application in finance and more specifically in the context of [futures contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp#:~:text=A%20futures%20contract%20is%20a,specified%20time%20in%20the%20future.&text=The%20buyer%20of%20a%20futures,when%20the%20futures%20contract%20expires.) for various commodities such as crude oil, LPG, etc.
